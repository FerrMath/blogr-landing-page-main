## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

As of now, I'm not satisfied with the quality of the code I made for this project, even if it currently works perfectly. As such I plan to redo the challenge with different approaches, specialy regarding the background images and organization of the code.
